        <div class="descrizione">
            <li><p> In this period there was a lot of tension between the <strong style="color:tomato;">USA</strong> and the Eastern countries.</p><p> In both blocs <strong style="color:tomato">fanaticism and fear of eachother</strong> dominated the countries: on one hand, <strong style="color:tomato;">the fear of communism</strong>, on the other hand,<strong style="color:tomato;"> the fear of capitalism.</strong></p> The american senator <strong style="color:tomato;">McCarthy</strong> promoted a <strong style="color:tomato;">"witch hunt"</strong> against the communists in the US and in the allied states (such as France and Italy).</p></li>
            <li><p>In the Eastern bloc there was the spread of <strong style="color:tomato;">communist totalitarian systems.</strong>  All protests were labelled at the service of America and, because of this, they needed to be repressed.</p> We remember the riots in <strong style="color:tomato">Budapest in 1956</strong> and the <strong style="color:tomato">Prague Spring of 1968.</strong></p>  Between <strong style="color:tomato;">1945</strong> and <strong style="color:tomato;">1975</strong>, there was a <strong style="color:tomato;">dissolution</strong> of the colonial empires of Britain, France, Belgium and Holland. </p></li>
            <li><p>  In  <strong style="color:tomato;"> Indochina </strong> there was the liberation movement, led by the Communist leader  <strong style="color:tomato;">  Ho Chi Minh </strong> that opposed the return of France after WW2 between 1945 and 1954.</p><p>The conflict ended in 1954 with the Geneva Accords and the French territories in that area became the states of <strong style="color:tomato;"> Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.</strong></p><p> The Vietnam was divided in two parts: <strong style="color:tomato;">the north</strong> was controlled by a <strong style="color:tomato;">communist regime</strong> and <strong style="color:tomato;"> the south</strong> ruled by a dictatorship supported by the USA. </p></li>
