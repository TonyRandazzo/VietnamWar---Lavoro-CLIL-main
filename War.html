          <li><p> The two Vietnams were supposed to become a <strong style="color:tomato";>single state in 1956</strong>, but elections to ratify the union were not held and tensions grew between the two governments.</p><p>In the south there was a riot of a guerrilla movement,<strong style="color:tomato;">the Vietcong</strong>, between 1957 and 1959 with the support of the USSR and China. </p><p> There was a violent war <strong style="color:tomato">(1964-1973)</strong> between the Vietcong and the USA that fought even with the air forces, especially under <strong style="color:tomato;">President Lyndon B. Johnson.</strong> </p></li>
          <li><p>The war ended with the intervention of the <strong style="color:tomato;">North Vietnamese (1975)</strong> and so with the <strong style="color:tomato;">supremacy of communism</strong> and the defeat of the US.</p><p> The public opinion has always been <strong style="color:tomato;">against this war</strong> because of the <strong style="color:tomato;"> inconsistent and insufficient reasons</strong> to explain the <strong style="color:tomato;"> very high</strong> economic and human costs.</p><p> Many Americans also began to<strong style="color:tomato;"> protest against the war</strong> and, for this reason, President Nixon, who could have won only by using <strong style="color:tomato;">atomic bombs</strong>, chose to retreat in <strong style="color:tomato">1973</strong> and in this way the United States lost the war. </p></li>
          <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rOJQuTD73Wk"><strong style="color:tomato">“C’era un ragazzo che come me amava i Beatles e i Rolling Stone”</strong></a> is a song by Gianni Morandi which was published in 1967. The song is a <strong style="color:tomato">protest against</strong> the war in Vietnam , for this reason it <strong style="color:tomato">was censored</strong> by the RAI because it disputed the choice of the USA which Italy was an <strong style="color:tomato">ally</strong> of.</p><p> Morandi talks about a young American boy who was full of dreams like him but had to set aside all the hopes for the future because he had to serve the country and he gave up everything to fight in the war. At the very end, he died on the battlefield where he was killed .</p></li>
