            <li><p> <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZWijx_AgPiA"><strong style="color: tomato;">"Fortunate Son"</strong></a> is a song by the American rock band <strong style="color: tomato;">Creedence Clearwater Revival</strong> and it was released during the peak period of the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.</p><p> The song became soon an <strong style="color:tomato">anti-war movement anthem</strong> and an expressive symbol of the counterculture's opposition to U.S. military involvement in the Vietnam War and solidarity with the soldiers fighting it. </p></li>
            <li><p> This is a song about <strong style="color:tomato">class and privilege.</strong> The text highlights the unfair advantages that the sons of the rich and the powerful have when it comes to being exempted from military service, tax payments and other obligations.</p><p> Born as a <strong style="color:tomato">critique of the inequality</strong> that exists in society and a celebration of the power of the working class, the song has been widely used to <strong style="color:tomato">protest against military actions </strong> as well as elitism in a broader sense in Western society, particularly in the United States.  </p></li>
            <li><p> <strong style="color:tomato">The media phenomenon</strong> in particular played a very important role in this war, in fact this <strong style="color:tomato">large flow of information</strong> that came <strong style="color:tomato">directly</strong> from the front and that told of the many atrocities that happened on the streets of the cities and in the Vietnamese countryside <strong style="color:tomato">greatly influenced</strong> the judgment and often the conscience of those at home.</p></li>
            <li><p> It is important to underline that public opinion was not an <strong style="color: tomato;">homogeneous</strong> and compact entity, indeed, it was divided into <strong style="color:tomato;">two blocks:</strong> on one hand there were those who feared the famous "reaction domino" and were afraid of the <strong style="color:tomato;">"virus of communism"</strong>, on the other hand the <strong style="color:tomato">pacifists</strong> who <strong style="color:tomato;">repudiated that conflict</strong>, judging it as a phenomenon without foundation and morality.</p></li>
