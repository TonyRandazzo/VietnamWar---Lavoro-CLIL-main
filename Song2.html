          <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uzQefqERKkA"><strong style="color:tomato">"Bài ca người nữ tự vệ sài gòn" (Song of women defending Saigon)</strong></a> is a song written by Pham Minh Tuan after the <strong style="color:tomato">1968's Mau Than battle</strong>, also known as the <strong style="color:tomato">Tet Offensive.</strong></p><p> The musician's songs were successful and <strong style="color:tomato">were appreciated</strong> by the Vietnamese public opinion since they were  innocent, romantic and full of love for the people of the South. </p><p> The song is about a <strong style="color:tomato">very young woman-fighter</strong> that is proud to actively <strong style="color:tomato">take part in the war</strong> on the Vietcong's side and is already announcing its future victory. </p></li>
          <li><p> In the period of the war the <strong style="color:tomato">women had an important role</strong> because they were patrolling many people who were joining the fighting, so they were becoming more and more <strong style="color:tomato">active participants</strong> in the liberation struggle against foreign invasions.</p><p> After the <strong style="color:tomato">Geneva Accords</strong>, the role of Vietnamese women became different from one place to another: in the <strong style="color:tomato">South</strong> they led the resistance in rural and urban areas and <strong style="color:tomato">fought political and military battles</strong>, representing 40% of guerrilla forces, while in the <strong style="color:tomato">North</strong> they had to <strong style="color:tomato">rebuild the bombed areas, treat the wounded, and bury the dead.</strong></p></li>
          <li><p> So when the North managed to take control of the whole country, <strong style="color:tomato">women's conditions</strong> began to retrocede, and that's the reason why still today many of them are <strong style="color:tomato">struggling to affirm themselves</strong> out of their domestic role.</p><p> In 2015 <strong style="color:tomato">United Nations</strong> recognized that Vietnamese women are affected by each of the <strong style="color:tomato">17 Sustainable Development Goals</strong>  contained in <strong style="color:tomato">Agenda 2030</strong>, but they also affirmed that those women can be key to achieve each of these goals in the country. </p></li>
